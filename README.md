# Codecurio
Hi, I’m Yaser— a first-year engineering student exploring the world of code with curiosity and purpose.

Codecurio is my personal space for learning, experimenting, and growing as a developer. I’m currently building strong foundations in C, Python, and Git, and I treat every academic lab as a mini-project — something worth documenting, refining, and sharing.

My interests lie in AI and machine learning, especially in open source. I’m working toward contributing to real-world projects and preparing for Google Summer of Code 2026, where I hope to make meaningful contributions to the developer community.

I believe in learning by doing. Whether it’s configuring Ubuntu, organizing my GitHub repos, or optimizing my laptop for both development and gaming — I’m always looking for ways to improve my workflow and deepen my understanding.

This repo reflects my journey: the challenges, the progress, and the mindset I’m building along the way. If you’re curious too, feel free to explore.
